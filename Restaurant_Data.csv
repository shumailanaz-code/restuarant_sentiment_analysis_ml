Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!",3,9,8,5/20/2019 0:35,0

Beyond Flavours,Sugandha Saxena,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",4,150,2135,5/18/2019 14:53,7

Beyond Flavours,Sind Hu,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.,3,61,167,5/18/2019 14:16,0

Beyond Flavours,Dyagamrahul,"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",3,25,24,5/16/2019 7:13,0

But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food.",5,3,2,5/15/2019 0:17,2

Beyond Flavours,Mudit,"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",2,1,2,05/12/2019 08:37,0

1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu.",3,20,23,05/12/2019 00:13,0

Beyond Flavours,Vignesh Rk,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.",1,13,67,05/11/2019 10:06,6

Beyond Flavours,Sreshta Ladegaam,"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.",1,25,722,05/09/2019 12:37,0

Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

We cancelled the order and walked away.

Management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. Or train their staff properly.

Profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality. Not the other way around.

They serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. We ordered Belgian Chocolate, Rajbhog and Kesar Pista ice creams cost near INR 75. All of them were delicious and mouth watering. Service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.

Went to buy their sourdough bread.ended up having their mushroom soup, death by chocolate cake and key lime tart.

Mushroom soup came with grilled sourdough, everything was good about it. The bread could be toasted with garlic butter

The bread itself we ended up using as garlic bread with our pasta at home which was really good. The bread is something we will go again to buy.

Lime tart Was better than expectation . The cream was way too much.

Death by chocolate was delicious, rich chocolate. Was not able to finish in one go, will have to get on it tomorrow again.

Highly recommend this place. Will go their again for there sandwiches/sourdough pizza and burger.",4,46,43,5/19/2019 20:40,3

Cafe Eclat,Moonis Ahmed,"What a great find. Went for a late night snacking/coffee and the food, service, ambiance were amazing.

We ordered Basque Chicken Sandwich and Very Cheesy Panini accompanies with an Iced Latte. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.

The very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 

Both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.

Service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 

Althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

Cafe Eclat,Vivani,I was so glad when we shifted to our new house because it was so close to this place! This is our favourite breakfast place on a lazy day especially when we are hungover. The Eggs Benedict with salmon is my favourite. Our visit to cafe Eclat is never complete without eating the amazing french toast! Do try it and you would cherish every single bite! I hardly have pictures because as soon as the food arrives we just attack! The one I have attached was taken to make my sister jealous :),5,14,5,04/11/2019 15:30,1
Cafe Eclat,Anil Rao,I ordered from this establishment many times in the past - and all the food was quite good - perhaps unlike anything in Hyderabad.  But today I wished to have the traditional Fish & Chips served in English and Irish pubs in the UK and America.  Theirs is Batter Dipped unlike other (sometimes more expensive) places - and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided (this is really hard  to get right in India in any case)- the result was a delicious facsimile.,5,9,,04/07/2019 18:15,0

They have a nice quiet small seating area which serves fresh continental, and desserts. I loved the quattro fromaggi, as it was made from fresh sourdough bread.

The only reason they lost a star is their high pricing on pastries (400 bucks for a cheesecake for example) and average cafe latte. But am a frequent customer here nonetheless, some guilty pleasures of life.",4,112,450,03/07/2019 08:39,0

This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels. This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.

Their croissant is quite good. They are actually one of the few places I would trust ordering a croissant from. They also make tarts and quiches. Their pasta is quite good.

Cafe Eclat,Ankana Chakraborty,"As a compulsive dessert and bread hogger, I was logically drawn towards the menu of this place. And it didn't disappoint.

If you are looking for a doughnut, please move away from those factory line produced, dense, overtly sweet and miserly filled ones. (It's about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid.) Eclat's doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be. The Berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth.

The New York Cheesecake is one of the best I've had in terms of texture. It's rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue. I do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through.

The chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city. The key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet.

Old review:
                         This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday. We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol",1,97,97,8/27/2018 13:17,3

Cafe Eclat,MVK,"Menu here is very interesting and we went with lot of expectations. 

For starters ordered - Chicken Broccoli Melt and Stuffed Bell Peppers. 

Chicken Broccoli Melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken, broccoli and cheese on top. The plate served to us is cold, we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw. Luckily the chicken is not raw! Bread is very hard and difficult to eat. Overall not worth ordering. 

Stuffed Bell Peppers - Tasted just ok. But loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole. 

Aglio E Olio - No complaints about this one. Tasted fine. 

Cabonara Chicken Pasta - So bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this. 

Quattro Formaggi Pizza - It is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good. So much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad. 

Overall, very bad experience which is forcing me to give a rating below 3.",2,38,128,7/21/2018 22:29,0

2. Eggs/Omlette meals, Pancakes are amazing if one is planning to go for breakfast/brunch.
3. Shakes / Coffee also gives a goodie goodie feeling.

Was disappointed with the look and tatse of the items for the price being charged. The food had no flavour at all. The croissant looked like some Patty from a local store.,2,20,15,6/30/2018 20:48,1
Cafe Eclat,Pallavi K,"had heard a lot about this place but this is my worst experience in Hyderabad. ordered for chocolate elixir and it was big disappointment. thankfully the staff agreed to change it. the price for the quantity yey they serve is very high.the place wasn't clean, there were so many flies, not maintained and cleaned. wouldn't recommend it to",1,44,25,6/23/2018 16:05,0
Cafe Eclat,Ganaeducations,Dont deliver from here. Cheesecake came as little almost the half of usual size of the one you get when dined. And they dont cook properly and use good ingredients for online orders. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not worth the money AT ALL,1,2,1,6/20/2018 12:04,0
Cafe Eclat,The Foodie Bookworm,"A posh cafe, not recommended for students.Visit only if its a treat. But food served it great just a little costly. The death by chocolate cake was an wonderful experience for me and also the carrot cake. I loved it. I had a white sauce based pasta too. But I am sorry I don't remember the exact name.

Cafe Eclat,Slo,"This has been a good find! Almond and au chocolate croissants were buttery light and delicious. Mushroom quiche though small, was filled with umami, served with caramelised onion. Their sandwiches use their own artisanal bread which gives great taste and texture. I love that their bread, pasta, pizza base, etc is all made in-house with quality ingredients and no preservatives and artificial flavouring. This is rare, and so nice! There's also some great looking fresh breads for sale‚Äî we picked one up, wrapped in paper.

There may be room for improvement with the coffee‚Äîmaybe stock some artisanal coffees from brands popping up in the country?

Overall, I'd recommend Eclat over a lot of the generic so-called cafes. People complaining about the price are better off visiting a Cafe Coffee Day.",4,4,9,06/01/2018 11:12,0
Cafe Eclat,Benazeer Khan,"We went for breakfast to cafe eclat on a Sunday morning. We ordered spinach omelette, belgian waffles, coffee and gelato.

Just a little overpriced and the portions are small.",4,44,33,5/28/2018 19:54,0
Cafe Eclat,Sushma Chitta,I thought this place was extremely overpriced for the taste and portions. Very small portions and not so great taste. Could have been much better! Although the presentation was good.,3,32,65,5/19/2018 13:56,3
Cafe Eclat,Arjun,"I loved the feel of the place as soon as I entered it. Though small but it's well maintained and gives you a cosy environment. Give the bakery items it specialises in, the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from.

The preparation is rich, fresh and gives a good after feeling once you've eaten it. I'd specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth. The Almond Croissant, Pain Au Chocolat are must try. Tomato and Cheddar Cheese Croissant too is something that was different and relishing. The hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just apt.

I'd certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too. But I'd recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders don't usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation. It's best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ;)",4,266,1559,5/16/2018 22:33,7
Cafe Eclat,John Benedict,"Came here on a hectic Monday.
Service was quick. The croissants were neatly baked and the cake pretty great as well.
I liked the part where they hand make and bake all their products. One can see the kitchen area through the windows.
The cake was neat as well and the coffee great,
This place opens at 7 AM hence making it a quick stop for breakfast and closes at 10 PM so makes it a great spot at all time. 
Prices are little on the higher side but it will all be worth it.
Will come here again for the great food.",4,63,334,5/15/2018 19:13,10

Cafe Eclat,Kamal Prakash,"I really liked the ambience. The blue cushions complimented the tables with wooden finish. The glass doors added to the elegance. The place was very calm. I had the cheesecake here, it literally melted in my mouth, absolutely loved it. One downside is that the place is a bit expensive.",4,14,31,05/10/2018 18:59,2
Cafe Eclat,Divya Iyer,"The first time I had something from Cafe Eclat was when we ordered Snack-boxes for a work event. Though a tad pricey, everything in that box was fresh and delicious - especially the complimentary brownie they had added.

We then went to to try out breakfast at this place. They have all the items that make a good continental breakfast, and also a variety of Omelettes. We ordered the Omelette meal, and the spinach and broccoli Omelette. We also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter. Everything arrived fresh and hot, and tasted great. In fact, I am wondering how I let go of the Belgian waffles on their menu. The portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day.

The next I visited was for a midnight dessert run, and tried the Rocher Caramel - which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher, much like your Ferrero Rocher, only larger. Man, that was huge and filled me up completely, but was worth every penny. 

So yes, the place is definitely pricey, but I have to say that they serve you the price's worth in taste and quality. Great place with many options, so must try!",4,13,50,05/10/2018 18:16,0
Cafe Eclat,Ananta Ray,"Went to this place couple of weeks back. Wasnt too hungry so thought of having some light snacks. But seeing the price of pastry at 250 + GST, i decided against it. When you add Art to your tagline, everything seem to be a bit more expensive. I am sure the pastries must be out of the world but for that nice. Not my cup of tea!

Had butter and chocolate croissant which were good and had a chocolate drink with mint which was average. 700 bucks for all this",1.5,90,300,05/03/2018 11:44,0
Cafe Eclat,Aditi Upadhyay,"The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of ""FRESH"" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing.",3,23,42,4/28/2018 19:55,0
Cafe Eclat,Rahul Gupta,"The place is near the Gachibowli flyover.
The ambience and decor is brilliant
I had Tiramisu here.. it was good. Though I expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu ..

You can make your own gelato in a jar here. Sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine.

I went there on a Wednesday evening and cafe was empty. Crowd must come on weekends I believe.

Labonel,Gopal Agarwal,"When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.

My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard. Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.

We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).

They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.

Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone.
I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.

I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.

My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.

Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.

I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)

Cupcakes that edge sweet without being overpowering so I can share with the ""I don't like desserts that are actually sweet"" crowd. Don't be surprised if you gulp down the entire box in a sitting.

A fine carrot cake cupcake that almost makes you feel like you're eating ""healthy"" until you eat the luscious cream cheese frosting. That's one of my top favorites.

I have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but I have tried their sample cakes multiple times and I can‚Äôt wait to order them.

Labonel,Ketaki Agharkar,"Although, I have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, I can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. Hochn√§sig is a word that came to my mind when I visited this place the first few times. Hoch is high and n√§sig comes from nose. This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as ‚Äúhochn√§sig‚Äù does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:

1.    This place is expensive.
2.    Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.
3.    They don‚Äôt sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.

Now coming to the gooooooood stuff‚Ä¶

Brownies:
The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that‚Äôs not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.

Chocolate Cakes:
I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.

Carrot Cake:
To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a ‚Äúfine baking‚Äù place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel‚Äôs carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.

Cheesecakes:
I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili‚Äôs are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.

Cupcakes:
Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.

Cookies:
Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm‚Ä¶

Miscellaneous:
There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.

Overall, if you don‚Äôt mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don‚Äôt give this place a miss.",4.5,20,60,11/03/2017 17:12,10
Labonel,Aditi Gupta,"#BrownieLove  # BakedWithLove

Classic calm interior. I loved their theme color ""Blue"". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. 

Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best. 
One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. 
Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. 

Suggestion: 
I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here. 
Why not offer a single piece or small one person box (3-4 pieces may be).",4,58,150,10/26/2017 11:53,1

My favs are brownies, red velvet, dark chocolate, white chocolte and all cup cake versions! They're so soft, melts in mouth, just so yummm in tummy:-)

Yes! They are very expensive. Almost costs a bomb !! 5500 Rs for a birthday cake but its all worth it once a while for any of your grand special occasion.. Go treat your tastebuds at Labonel üëç",4,96,1175,5/18/2017 16:33,10

Before the pickup I just called them to check if the cake is ready and they simply say there is no order on my name at all. This is pure irresponsibility on the part of Labonel Gachibowli.

I'm not too good with dessert consistency and stuff, but all i can say is this is a place I would definitely recommend for dessert treats and parties.
The brownies are moderately sweet and rich and not too moist.

Labonel,Shruthi Naidu,"I have been lusting after this place, after reading too many 5 star reviews on Zomato.  So yesterday the occasion was right  and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my  pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.  

Final note: Never ever  going to visit the place again. Overrated place",2,6,6,2/15/2017 23:48,0

Labonel,Ankita Shah,"Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.
My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste.

Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend.",5,74,169,1/13/2017 19:03,0

My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..!

Labonel,Krati Mathur,"Updated review:
Ever since my first visit to Labonel I have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too. This cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. All the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. They are definitely at the top of their game right now.
P.S. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.

Previous review:
A class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. Labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. All this while I avoided this sweet gem coz I assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.
Because I was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, I quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. Heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....I can go on and on raving about this piece of art. I do like to clear the air about misconception of Labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. A box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;P

There has always been a lot of hype about Labonel, especially for their cupcakes. I personally disliked the red velvet cupcakes because of the buttercream frosting. Second, the cupcakes were available only in boxes and not individually which wasn't cost effective or practical at all.

However, I tried their brownies at a later point through a friend's purchase. They are quite delicious. I would definitely have more. But wouldn't go through the effort of buying a whole box.",3.5,7,1,10/13/2016 1:04,0

Attractive packaging.

Above all, the Taste. The products tasted real good.

I feel the cheese üßÄ on my mouth when I was having the cheese melt wrap. Chicken was tender and cooked real soft. They are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. Wrap was cooked equally good.

Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap was awesome. It gave a different taste altogether.

Highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. Rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. It can be had by both - children and elders. They have two differential cooked chicken on the top. Both are boneless and cooked with perfection. Only the ingredients differ.

Honestly, my excitement dropped down after tasting the parathas, as they were too greasy. Paneer curry, on the other hand, was the savior, Vadas were fine and Kheer was up to the mark. What I liked about the thali was that it had more than enough food for 1 person. I am going with 2 stars as the parathas are the base of this thali and I couldn't finish even half of it.

Pizza wrap has cheese, vegetables and other sauces in it. It gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.The size is big and is good enough as a meal for one person

I have also tried chola kulcha and Veg thali from Faasos but in Bangalore,they were also very good.

I have tried almost all of their major wraps :

Pizza Wrap (5/5)
Mac n Cheese wrap (4.5/5)
Cheesy corn Salsa(4/5)
Aloo wrap (3.5/5)
Jumbo Veg wrap(3/5)
Egg wrap (3.5/5)
Paneer Tikka Wrap (3.5/5)
Rajma Chole is also very good.

Desserts:
I recently tried their Red Velvet cheese cake and it was also mind blowing and definitely worth a try!!It was one of the best red velvet cheese cake,I have ever had
Red velvet (5/5)
Raspberry Cheesecake shot(4.5/5)
Chocolate Fantasy (4/5)

Must try their wraps and especially Pizza wrap!!!",5,179,1877,11/04/2018 11:43,12

Faasos,Shashank Vyas,"Zomato has asked me to be polite.. ok.. Faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality... When you order a pizza roll.. they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills... They roast it till the end.. just like how your mumma used to make it.. and best part comes next.. Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive... It's too much fun to see that status - ""Food is being prepared"" , ""Your food is in the kitchen"".. and they won't update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise.. In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll.. And he was right.. I never saw the roll only charcoal.. ( attached picture for reference )",1,2,21,11/02/2018 02:13,1

Faasos,Hungry Soul,"Navratri review program~

I ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast. The packaging was good and the order was delivered on time. The thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts ,curd, sabudana kheer, paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry. Everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. There could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. The taste was no doubt best. Fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together. It was a little expensive though but it's worth it.üòÄ Unique menus are always welcome.

I am unable to attach all the pics though coz i already reviewed the delivery once which somehow got deleted. Deserves a 4.5 üòÄ

Keep up the good work. üòÄ",4,175,1302,10/31/2018 17:10,2

Parathas were excessively oily. Paneer and tomato curries tasted awful. Everything tastes candy sweet. I couldn't eat any of it apart from a bite to just taste.

The meal was a complete let down.

It was not as expected. Did not taste quite well. The parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark. The kheer was not sweet enough. Not a big fan of their Navratri box.

Got a chance to review their Navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with Singhada ke aloo parantha,paneer makhanwala,sabudhana ki kheer,green tomato curry and curd. Best part was paneer makhanwala , it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for Navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha üéâ The meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting! I rated it 4 because of spilling of oil and tomato which is a bit half cooked else everything was perfectly enroute deli ‚ô•Ô∏è

Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination..Loved it..

Paneer wrap - It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

I got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review.
If you've to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll. It had right amount of spices. The cheese paneer roll was too bland. It had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty.

The quantity was good enough for one. Would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination.

Cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above I expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.

Service is very very slow even on a weekday. It took so much time for kababs to come.

Often they say, if you arrive late, make it grand. We hoped the food will be awesome as they might took so much time to prepare it. But alas! the food is disgusting!

Not recommended at all. Go only if you're getting offer like more than 60% off.. Otherwise complete waste of money!",1,1,,05/07/2019 18:07,0

Food: Pathetic! I am living in Hyderabad for last 10 years. I haven't had so pathetic kababs here in Hyderabad, like what I got at arena eleven.

Overall a BIG NO. Please don't waste your money here.

1. Ordered fish lemon pepper kabab.. It was too salty.

2. Ordered chicken tikka kabab. You can't even chew the chickn pieces, it was so hard & tasteless.

Arena Eleven,Tanya Karanjai,"Arena eleven sports bar

IPl is here and whats better way to enjoy it than watching it in a sports bar! There aren't many sports bar around and Arena Eleven is the swankiest ones in town. Located in the SNL terminal , this is the best destination if you are a sports fan.

AMBIENCE (4/5): The seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner. They have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place. Beautifully designed restro, Arena Eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food. They have some good tracks playing which I liked as well.They have indoor as well as outdoor seating.Outdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city.

FOOD AND BEVERAGES ( 4/5) :

You can opt for either ala carte or buffet.The place has both options.

Mocktails and cocktails : In mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried. This had grape juice , with fresh apple and bartenders mix. Then we tried Mint Julep which was fresh otange wedges with mint,lime and orange juice. It was decent.Zen Zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks ,brown sugar ,ginger and fresh mint topped with cola. It was nothing special and was too sweet.Virgin mojito was as it should be.

In cocktails we tried Old Fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters. This one was a little too concentrated and strong for me.next we had Kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and Cinnamon. It was a delightfull drink.Then was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix. This drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste.

Food:

1. Veg manchaow soup : The soup did not appeal my pallate . It was moreovee tasting like rasam than a Chinese soup.

2. Tandoor items : we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good.

3. Tandoori non veg sizzler : This was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka , fish tikka .it was absolutely delighfull.

4.Tandoori veg sizzler : This had paneer tikka,veg seekh kabab.the veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour.

5. Hot wings : The hot wings were sweet to taste where as ,as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy. This was a disappointing one

6.Tandoori chicken tandri : Tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices.

7. Masala Fries : This is a very new concept which I tried for the first time. The masala fries were served with chopped onions.It was really good and we couldn't stop at one or two.

8.Chilli fish : chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style.

8. Chicken Tikka Pizza : chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings. This was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce. The crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked.

9. Chicken seekh kabab : I absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through.

10. Veg seekh kabab : the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavours.could be better.

11. Chicken green curry and steamed rice : the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes. The consistency was also creamy. The taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour.

12. Chicken tikka biryani ( from the buffet) : absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning. The hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall.

DESSERTS

1. Gajar ka halwa : I absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa. Warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along ,it felt divine.

2. Kheer : the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste.

The place is really nominal with good food. With this rate charged and the sports add on it provides,this place is absolutely recommended.",4,44,133,05/01/2019 21:54,10

Ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating.

A pocket friendly restaurant with awesome food menu.

I have been there on multiple times once with a friend and also by a invite. Both of my experiences are much better then the before one.

My favorites at Arena eleven are the kebab sizzling platters, the assorted sizzling platters are so succulent and tasty with the hot sizzle.

I Love the chicken pizza the thin crust and the toppings are really good.

Thai Green Curry with steam rice are one of my favorite, but just they need to be little consistent.

Chicken tikka biryani is the USP of arena eleven menu, it's really too good in taste and the quality.

I had the best non alcoholic Sangria here. It was the best so far, must try this.

Arena eleven has very good and economical lunch buffet, the spread is much worth at price of Rs: 550/-

Rice kheer is my favorite in desserts.",5,251,2199,4/30/2019 23:46,10
Arena Eleven,Bharti Mehta,"Visited Arena 11 for a Sunday Branch. It was Easter Sunday and the place was packed. Also, since the IPL season is on, this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list.

The have Sunday Buffet Brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious. Though the presentation can be improved alot.

We also tasted their ala carte menu, a few of the items were good but their isn't much consistency with their dishes.

At once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par.

Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka, Honey Chilli Chicken Wings and Tangri Kebab were served.

The Lemon Fish Tikka and Tangdi Kebab were good but Honey Chilli Chicken Wings were too sweet for my palate.

The Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries were good.

In buffet, the Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani stood out.

Also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great.

I suggest them to add some more variety for desserts",3,84,387,4/30/2019 20:26,0
Arena Eleven,Kamran Hussain Khan (Intensefoodcravingsblog),"Arena Eleven is a sports bar ,located at the plush and financial province of Hitec city .There is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. The menu is extensive. There is plenty of waitstaff. Our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied, and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to.
We say outside seating gives you are brief view of the surrounding areas and the view is simply beautiful playing. The music selections were good, but not too loud.
The portions were very generous. .
There are many TV screens for sports viewing indoor, and even a few outdoor.
An overall good atmosphere..They have a buffet and alacarte kind of system here ..upon ourvisit here we tried their buffet and ordered few delicacies from their Alacarte menu as well ..the food the drinks everything was on point .one can surely enjoy this place at any time of the day .as this place is a sports bar as such the reservation is recommended during any sport featurings .do head to this place if you are a sports buff and if yournt one as you will have a great time at this place

But after taking money they didn't provide a table. My team stood there for almost 50mins. Later we were forced to walk out. They did refund the money bt had to go through alot before getting it back. Guys there are lot of good places for watching IPL. This is a shit place...u will end up destroying ur day.

Arena Eleven,Yash Kumar Singh,"It's during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town. But not to worry as Arena Eleven's here to woo the same crowd, with their delightful sports-themed decor offering big-screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience. Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, the tagline for the place is ""Kebabs, Beers & Sports"" each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly.

The menu for the place is particularly compact, serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets. Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a'la carte section, we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good. The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice, namely Veg Shami, Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base. Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture. Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions, ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks.

Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab, Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind. My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however, for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination. Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce, probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers. Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever - bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning. The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper.

Running a buffet on weekends, the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from. Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice, where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani. After the disappointment in the starters, it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were. Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added, going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis. Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste. Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a'la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale, which definitely didn't justify the price tag for the same. The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average.

The service too wasn't any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help. Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task, however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well. The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace, they almost always lacked consistency. The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called, brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate. All in all, if the place provides a run-of-the-mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely.

Arena Eleven,Vasanthi Singampalli,"Arena Eleven, nestled in SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, is a sports-themed bar and restaurant with live screenings all around. With two large screens and three televisions, no matter where your table is, you will be able to catch all the sporting action. During the day, the clarity of the large screens is lower, because of the bright light from the glass panes. The best part of the outdoor seating section is that it is located just beside the botanical garden with a sumptuous view of the green cover. Perfect to enjoy the cool breeze, watch a match and hang out with friends. 
 The bar menu offers an extensive range of classic cocktails with a good variety of imported spirits and liqueur. They serve a widespread buffet with an array of mains. The starters will be served to the table.
In the starters, we tried the Sizzling tikka platter which consists of Chicken Tandoori, lemon pepper Chicken, Tangdi Chicken, Paneer Tikka, Veg Seekh Kabab and Fish tikka. Tangdi Chicken made a perfect starter, soft and succulent chicken legs coated with a host of spices and grilled to perfection. Fish Tikka was melting in the mouth with good flavors. In veg, don't miss out in Paneer Tikka. It was so soft and properly cooked with the right amount of spices infused. Veg Seekh Kebab was good when we had it for the first time. But when ordered for the next time, it was very dry.
Apart from the Tikka platter, we tried Chicken 65, Honey chili wings, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish and Masala Fries. I loved all of them.

In the main course, from the buffet, they have two non-veg curries and two veg curries and assorted bread. Curries tasted delightful with rich gravy and spices on point. Ordered and tried their Thai Veg curry, which disappointed me, as it was too sweet. Chicken Tikka Biryani is a hit, It was as tasty as it looks. It was very different from the regular Hyderabadi Biryani yet very delicious. 
Tried the Butter Chicken Masala Pizza. Though the toppings were great, the pre-baked base which they used dropped the taste.

From desserts, they have Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. Tasted Ok-ish , not so great.

Drinks need some improvements, as some are very sweet.

If improved on the glitches in the food and drinks, its a great place to Eat, drink, socialize and watch your favourite sports live.",4,78,181,4/24/2019 13:15,27
Arena Eleven,Anvith Devulapally,"Rating: 3.5

Replacing Serafina, Arena Eleven is a new addition to the SLN Terminus mall. With TV screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia, the place is a crowd-puller during this IPL season. The place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden.

Our Sunday lunch started with a few drinks. Mint Julep, Virgin Mojito, Virgin Sangria, Virgin Pina Colada, Zen Zero - a mojito like drink with cola, Calvados - their version of a hot toddy, Old fashioned and Kentucky Apple Cinnamon. Though the cocktails were potent, they lacked finesse. Mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down. The better ones of the lot were Calvados, Apple Cinnamon and Mint Julep.

In the starters, we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken, lemon pepper, malai, nasheman, paneer and fish tikkas. The stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas. We also tried their Tangdi kebab, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish, salt and pepper wings, chicken 65, honey chili wings, chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce, masala fries, chicken and veg sheek kebabs. One thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency. Our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more. The second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless. The tangdi kebab was well made. Soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor. The chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious!

I visited this place twice. During the first visit, I tried the Chicken peri peri tikka roll, Chicken Rajiala, Onion Kulcha and Thai Green Chicken curry for mains. The roll was passable. We were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it didn't really prove to be. It tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry. Nothing special. The thai green chicken curry blew us off with it's flavors. Each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together, it was magic! Pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons! During the second visit, we chose to eat the mains from their Sunday buffet and it was not a great decision. Except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani, the rest were tasteless. We also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a pre-made base and tasted substandard. We ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet.

They only had a couple of desserts in both instances - Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. They were just run-of-the-mill kind and didn't have any oomph factor.

Overall, one thing that the place needs is consistency. Their tag reads Kebabs. Beer. Sports but the kebabs part isn't really justified. Service is decent. They need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace. They have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset!

Arena Eleven,Shreshth Malhotra,"Arena Eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city. Located inside the SLN terminus, it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby IT hubs.

I went over there to try out their Weekend Buffet. First things first, their Buffet layout was well spread. The starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from. The drinks offered by them included Mojito, Zen Zero and Mint Julep. The drinks were average and needs quite improvement.

Speaking about their starters, I had their Chicken Tangdi, Malai Paneer tikka, Salt and Pepper prawns, Lemon pepper Chicken tikka, Mutton Seekh kebab and Veg Seekh kebab.

Amongst all the starters, I loved their Chicken tangdi kebab. The chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection. The use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat. Next up, I also liked their Lemon pepper Chicken tikka. It had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper.

For mains, the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes, two veg main course dishes accompanied by Dal, Assorted breads, Biryani and Salads. The chicken dishes were Chicken curry and Chicken tikka masala. I found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken. For veg, their was Mutter Paneer and Paneer butter masala. I liked their Mutter Paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.

Their Biryani was a slight disappointment for me. It could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn't really serve justice to the dish. Apart from this, I also had my hands on their Veg thai curry. It was served with steamed rice. To be honest, the preparation of Thai Green Curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version. Maybe, they can work upon the use of Cocunut cream in the curry.

For desserts, I had their Gajar ka Halwa, Kheer and Ice cream. The desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together.

All in all, the place has got a huge potential. All they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items. Happy eating. :)",4,275,1989,4/22/2019 12:21,8

Sizzling non-veg Tikka Platter with 3 tikkas of your choice.
Jamaica Chicken Tikka - the best of the lot and a must try.
Nasheman Chicken Tikka - not so appealing but ok ok types taste.
Malai fish tikka - soft and tasty
Bhuna Chicken - one of the best I have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious, so this is a must try
Chicken Rajiala - A green gravy with boneless chicken, not so tasty
Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was too good especially for Chinese lovers
Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani - look wise it was actually sizzling, but not so much taste wise. Chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked.
Ginger Coke - Please do not try this one, as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink

Arena Eleven,Raja Srivathsav,"They‚Äôve opened up recently and I think they have a long way to reach good management.
Other than beer, I‚Äôve tried their LIT and a classic martini!
They‚Äôve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar.
Food was delicious.
I‚Äôve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

The only problem I faced was table management.
Each time I had to order, I literally had to shout and wave my hands multiple times to get someone‚Äôs attention to my table.

Arena Eleven,Surya Mukherjee,Visited for a lunch buffet with my office colleagues. I have booked table using dineout where I got 50% off (300/-) on lunch buffet which was definitely a great deal. We were 14 members altogether. We were served welcome drinks and followed by starters. Which was nicely cooked. Then we approached towards main course. Although I didn't try much because I was already full with starters. I tried their desert which was nice. Overall a nice place for dining out. But I think this place should be visited at night while watching football match or some IPL match with beers and kebabs. Great place to hangout.,4,75,464,04/04/2019 10:31,0

Arena Eleven,Arpa Ghosh,"I visited this place with my wife on 16 March,2019.  Its located in SLN terminus. We were looking for a place to dine after our movie at Platinum, and we decided to give this place a try. Was it worth it, lets find out.

Ambiance
============
We entered this place around 10 pm on a Saturday night and this place was  literally bustling with crowd. They have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge, and all of them played sports channel, ranging from Cricket to Premier League Football. We were promptly seated at the Verandah. The view from there is quite something. We got seated in a semi lit corner. The place has a cozy feeling and good vibes. Liked it. Ratings - 4/5.

Service
============
Pathetic. Needs a lot of improvement. They took some time to produce the Menu, and then the waiter just didn't show up for the order, for next 15 minutes at-least. We ordered food and drinks. The food was delayed and drinks just did't come. We had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks at-least, so that we can end our boredom. Luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served. When asked for the bill, they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier, saying printer was faulty. Phew! Ratings - 1/5.

Food
============
Did food proved to be the Savior for the night? Read on.  We ordered a cranberry breezer, virgin mojito and couple of Pinacoladas(Yes, we took advantage of Gold membership). The virgin mojito was pathetic. Period.  The Pinacoladas were really good. We ordered for Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter, which was strictly okay.  Well the service and food really disappointed. Ratings - 3/5.

Value for Money
=============
We shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks, that too have taken the gold membership advantage. High pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand. So no way its VFM. Ratings - 1.5/5.

Let's calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 2.375

Final Thoughts
=============
This place has all the potential to be nice a sports bar, and I feel that their service and food really needs improvement!",2,32,70,3/23/2019 18:07,2
Arena Eleven,George B.,"Experience at Arena Eleven... Since it‚Äôs in SLN Terminus mall it‚Äôs not very difficult to find. It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! Place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet. Ups, that‚Äôs really bad!

Ambiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! Usually I don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. They have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. There is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.

Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!

When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. We had sizzling kebab platter. Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. Awesome kebabs!! Really juicy and tasty every each one of them. We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. They didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought. Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. The let down were the rolls. We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. Maximum average on quality and taste.
The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!

I left the restaurant in the middle as except bira beer everything was pathetic even in last Management guy declined to provide me the bill and was VERY VERY rude, waited for around 15 minutes after paying the amount just to get the bill.

Ambience was good with very nice choice of music. Night view would be very nice.
Choice of starters was limited but the taste was good. Chicken kebab with a tinge of lemon was the best. However fish was undercooked.
Surprisingly main course was quiet tasty with chicken tikka masala being the best.
On the dessert side, kheer was a spot on.
At the end i would like to tell the worst part of my experience which was the service. An utter dissapointment.
The waiter's arguing behaviour and careless service ruined my mood. I would ask the owner to please teach some basic behaviour to this waiter. I dont know his name but i think he is just ruining his fellowmates career as well.

Chose this over some top restaurants at SLN Terminus and I must say I wasn't disappointed.

The buffet has a simple menu with nearly 20 items. Food tasted decent but the desserts should be improved by miles as they create final impressions in any buffet.

Ambiance is quite good with Indoor and Outdoor seating, the place was fully packed on a Weekday afternoon.
It has 2 screens and 5 TVs for sports viewing üëç

This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided.

There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani & Veg Pulao.  Both of these dishes were same I don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.

In terms of the service, I ordered the food from Zomato at 8.00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55PM.  I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.

I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani & Pualo.

Service wise I would rate this place a 2.5

It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery.

Olive Garden,Dinesh Rajagiri,"We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.
So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.

Starters Veg- Crispy baby corn, paneer chilli, cheese nuggets, noodles, veg soup, veg Manchuriyan. Out of all cheese nuggets and veg Manchuriyan was very yummy. Others were good.

Starters Non veg- appollo fish was very tasty and was on the spicy side, chicken tandoori was good. The chicken soup was thick and delicious.

Maincourse- Veg Biriyani, chicken biriyani and white rice. Chicken curry was tasty and the chicken was nicely cooked. The mutton curry was not up to the mark. There are different bread items like butter Naan, kulcha and butter roti also. Other items like veg curry, dal fry, rasam was ok.

Desserts- Fresh cut watermelon, ice cream, Bombay halwa. The gulabjamun and the caramel custard was super delicious.

Extra items- papad, fryums, sprouts etc.
Ambience- good.
Crew members- Friendly and did their service well.

Overall experience was good, as it provides good variety of items in a pocket friendly price.",4,48,67,8/14/2018 17:13,4

Olive Garden,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),"New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here.",3,104,334,7/31/2018 20:53,0

We ordered schezwan chicken and corn palak roll for starters.. The Corn rolls were soo fresh.. It tasted amazing.. Chicken was spicy and nice too..

Veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. There was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. Taste was on another level.. Biryani was spicy.. A little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. But rest of the items compensated for this..

I highly recommend this place.. Will definitely visit again and again.. üòÑ

Olive Garden,Baishali Ghosh,"FOOD:
The food was quite delicious.
I ordered oregano fish tikka, which was really nice.
I had also ordered egg spring rolls which were very tasty but I felt they could be crispier.
For main course, I had plain naan and dum ka murgh which went really well with the naan.

SERVICE:
Staff was very corteous and polite and very attentive. Plates were changed and food was continually served.
Also they support Amex, which was quite nice as I am unable to use my CC at a lot of restaurants.

AMBIENCE:
This is a nice place to come with family or group of friends. It is not very fancy but they have a private hall as well so if you're looking for a closed off area to dine, you have that option.",4,27,18,7/27/2018 1:31,0
